	abstract = {*** {NOTE}: Your device (handheld or wearable) must have a built-in pressure sensor (preferred) or {GPS} (solely as a fallback if barometer is missing). With this app, the wearable will *not* poll {GPS} data from the paired phone. Android Wear watches equipped with a pressure sensor include Nixon Mission (165Hz sample rate), {LG} G Watch R (90Hz), {LG} Watch Sport (10Hz), {LG} Watch Urbane, and Huawei Watch (20Hz); with a {GPS} only, Moto 360 Sport and Sony Smartwatch 3. ***Smart Altimeter uses pressure sensor on your device to measure your altitude above sea level or previously chosen reference altitude (if your device does not have a barometer, the app will fall back to {GPS}). Advanced multiple-layer algorithms are used to smooth noisy measurements and to calculate descent rate. The app can also speak your current altitude.Use of devices with high-speed barometric sensors (60Hz or faster) is highly recommended for the feedback lag not to exceed 0.2s (the lag is 12 samples).},

	title = {L/D Vario},
	url = {https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PFM.LDVario},
	abstract = {L/D Vario is an app for gliding airsports such as wingsuit flying, tracking, canopy piloting, paragliding, etc. It is a complete flight instrument, measuring the most important aerodynamic parameters of the gliding flight: lift-to-drag ratio (L/D), air glide ratio ({GR}), current horizontal and vertical airspeeds, and sustained horizontal and vertical speeds normalized to sea level (a.k.a. the polar curve). It uses the accelerometer and barometer (or {GPS}) in your device and solves Wingsuit Equations in real time to measure flight parameters and provide instant visual and audio feedback.Unlike {GPS} that measures ground glide ratio (which is distorted by wind and dynamic maneuvers such as dives and plane outs), L/D Vario measures true, instant L/D — your aerodynamic finesse — independent of wind and dynamic distortions, so you can maximize your L/D much faster and more reliably. Also, it calculates the glide ratio relative to the air, not to the ground, since it uses the altitude from the barometer (or {GPS}) which is not distorted by the wind, unlike the {GPS} position/groundspeed. Advanced multiple-layer algorithms are used to calculate smooth descent rate and vertical acceleration from noisy altitude data. All these flight parameters - L/D, {GR}, sustained and current airspeeds - help you understand various flight modes and learn quickly how to fly better.To use the app in flight, your device needs to be mounted on a vane that is positioned in undisturbed air stream (away from the body and wing at least 2-3 feet) and is precisely aligned with the relative wind at all times, so that its Y-axis (from screen bottom to top) is parallel to the relative wind, and X-axis (left-right) is parallel to the ground. You can then use your Bluetooth headphones to listen to the feedback tone and voice.Use of devices with high-speed barometric sensors (60Hz or faster) is highly recommended for the feedback lag not to exceed 0.2s. Some known devices with high-speed barometers include: phones - Google Nexus 4 and Sony Z3 Duos (30Hz), smartwatches - {LG} G Watch R (90Hz), Huawei Watch (20Hz), Nixon the Mission (165Hz).},
