In this paper, we have designed, implemented and reviewed AccuDrop, an app designed to assist skydivers in tracking their jumps and improving their safety. We have proven that today's smartphones with barometer and GNSS capabilities are capable of accurately logging skydiving environments up to a tested altitude of \SI{4250}{\metre}. Landing pattern calculation and skydive review features can increase the safety of a skydiver by informing them of safe, predictable landing patterns and giving tools to visualise mistakes made during a skydive.

Insufficiencies were revealed through the paper, showing that long-range communication between smartphones without the use of cell towers still has much room for improvement both in their range and the systems used to control them.

Proposals for improvements to the AccuDrop system have been made; we suggest that other projects carry these further.
