  % The problem
  Skydiving is a challenging sport to learn, combine this with the safety risks that follow and there are many potentials for learner skydivers to cause damage to themselves or others. Aids for the improvement of a skydiver's learning are often expensive and inaccessible.

  % Solution and method
  This paper goes into detail about how we created a proof of concept Android smartphone app to aid the learning progression of a new skydiver and provide insight into their skydives. The app can give the user pre-jump information for planning, track a skydiver's position during a skydive and present collected data for review by the user after a jump.

  % Conclusion about the success of the solution
  The evaluation of the app produced has indicated that we can use smartphones to aid skydivers before, during and after a skydive, but also that there is much room for improvement in the technologies used.
