  % The problem
  Skydiving is a challenging sport to learn. When combined with the inherent safety risks that are involved, there are many ways in which learner skydivers may cause damage or injury to themselves or others. Aids for the improvement of a skydiver's learning are often expensive and inaccessible. Learning by mistake is not a viable option.

  % Solution and method
  This paper describes how we created a proof of concept Android smartphone app to aid the learning progression of a new skydiver and provide the new skydiver with insight into their skydives. The app can give the user pre-skydive information for planning, track a skydiver's position during a skydive and present collected data for review by the user after a skydive.

  % Conclusion about the success of the solution
  The evaluation of the app produced indicated that smartphones may be used to aid skydivers before, during and after a skydive can be an effective alternative to premium devices currently on the market, but also that there is much room for improvement in the technologies used within the app.
