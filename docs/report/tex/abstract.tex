  % The problem
  Skydiving is a challenging sport to learn. When combined with the inherent safety risks that are involved, there are many ways in which learner skydivers may cause damage or injury to themselves or others. Tools for the improvement of a skydiver's learning are often expensive and inaccessible. Learning by mistake is not a viable option.

  % Solution and method
  This paper describes how we created a proof of concept Android smartphone app to aid the learning progression of a new skydiver and provide them with insight into their skydives. The app can give the user pre-jump information for planning, track a skydiver's position during a jump and present collected data for review by the user post-jump.

  % Conclusion about the success of the solution
  The evaluation of the app produced, indicated that smartphones may be used to aid skydivers before, during and after a skydive, can be an effective alternative to premium devices currently on the market, but also that there is much room for improvement in the technologies used within the app.
