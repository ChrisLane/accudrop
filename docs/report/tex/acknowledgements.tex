  % Supervisor
  I would like to thank my supervisor, Alan, for helping to guide me through this project and helping me to see its full potential, without his help there would have been some much more significant roadblocks to my progress. His external view as someone with little to no skydiving knowledge initially has helped to make aspects of the project more accessible to the average person, that may be looking into skydiving for the first time.

  % App testers
  Secondly, I would like to thank my app testers Alp and Tim who have been making suggestions and reporting bugs related to the app as well as collecting actual skydive data using the app.

  % Friends
  Lastly, I would like to thank my friends for supporting me throughout the project, lending me their phones, and giving very welcome inspiration and encouragement.
