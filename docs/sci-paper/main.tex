\title{Using Smart Devices as Tools in Safety Critical Skydiving Applications}
\author{Christopher Lane}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract} % "Helps decide if someone should read the paper"
Smart devices such as smartphones and smartwatches today have many different sensors, often with high frequency and accuracy. One sensor that is becoming more common in smart devices is the barometer, this allows for air pressure to be measured, making altitude calculations possible. Since skydiving equipment is typically expensive, it would be useful for skydivers to enhance their skydiving experience using the smart devices that they already own. This article will discuss how an app might be created in order to give guidance to a skydiver to improve their canopy piloting.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}
\subsection{Apps} % Existing apps, what they accomplish, how they do it, what they do well, what they don't do well (solved by me!)

%% L/D Vario %%
% Built for gliding airsports.
% Offers details on glide ratio, lift-to-drag ration, altitude, horizontal and vertical speed.
% Advanced version of the smart altimeter app.
% Uses a device's barometer to make calculations relative to the air.
% "Advanced multiple-layer algorithms are used to calculate smooth descent rate and vertical acceleration from noisy altitude data."
% The device needs to be mounted away from the body in undisturbed air stream.
% Highly recommends the use of devices with barometric sensors of 60Hz or faster
The~\citetitle{pfm_technologies_llc_l/d_2015} app by~\textcite{pfm_technologies_llc_l/d_2015} is an app that is built for ``gliding airsports''. The app allows for users to view their glide and lift-to-drag ratios, altitude, horizontal and vertical speeds among other things. The app seems to be built upon the much simpler~\citetitle{pfm_technologies_llc_smart_2016} app from the same author that only offers altitude and descent speed readings.
The~\citetitle{pfm_technologies_llc_l/d_2015} app uses the handheld or wearable smart device's barometer to make calculations relative to the air around it that result in the device's current altitude from either sea level or a user-defined reference point. Data important to wingsuiters is calculated with the help of the device's accelerometer. It is recommended that devices with barometric sensors of 60Hz or higher are used to reduce latency in altitude calculations. The authors also recommend that the device be mounted away from the body, at least 2--3 feet from a wingsuiter's wings, this is presumably to reduce the risk of the wings or body affecting the pressure readings in the device.

%% BlueFlyVario %%
% App designed to read data from the BlueFlyVario bluetooth pressure sensor from https://www.blueflyvario.com/
% Designed for for paragliding and hang gliding.
% Shows data such as altitude, wind speed, heading, flight time.
~\citetitle{dickie_blueflyvario_2016} is another app designed for gliding airsports, by~\textcite{dickie_blueflyvario_2016}. The app is designed to read data from the~\citetitle{noauthor_blueflyvario_nodate}~\cite{noauthor_blueflyvario_nodate} pressure sensor, providing data such as altitude wind speed, heading and flight time.
The app's use of an external barometric sensor is useful since it ensures that results across all devices running the app will be consistent and that the required hardware specifications of the barometer are met.
While the app does offer plenty of useful information, the user interface does seem cluttered and not user friendly. Since we do not have the~\citetitle{noauthor_blueflyvario_nodate} pressure sensor, we could not test any features of the app or sensor, however, with the website claiming ``altitude resolution of 10cm''~\cite{noauthor_blueflyvario_nodate} it can be seen why it would be desirable.

%% SpotAssist %%
% A tool for skydivers.
% Shows wind conditions at drop zones, safe plane exit area and recommended landing pattern based on changeable parameters (wind direction/speed, landing direction)
\citetitle{inc_spot_2017}~\cite{inc_spot_2017} is a different kind of app, focussing on pre and post-skydive assistance. Features of the app include wind condition forcasting, safe plane exit area calculating, cutaway finder and a landing pattern simulator. The wind condition forecasting shows information for different altitudes, information that is not typically available on standard forecast websites. The cutaway finder feature allows users to say where they cut away their main canopy so that the app can make an estimate of where the canopy may have landed based on wind speed and direction. The two likely most useful features for learner skydivers or skydivers at a new drop zone are the safe exit and landing pattern recommendations. The app is able to show a satellite image of drop zones and overlay recommendations on where to turn to land or where to exit the plane in order to be able to land in the target area. The app does not offer any features to feed exit or landing pattern data to skydivers during a jump and many features are restricted by a one time purchase or subscription.
